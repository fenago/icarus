# Index Code: VectorDB - (Pinecone)

This Python script is setting up a server for a document search engine. The search engine uses an index to quickly find documents based on a query. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

- It imports necessary modules and sets an environment variable for the OpenAI API key. This key is used for OpenAI's GPT-3/4 model, which is likely used for processing the documents and queries.

- It defines some global variables: index for the search index, `stored_docs` for storing the documents, and lock for thread-safety.

- It defines a function `initialize_index` to load an existing index from disk or create a new one if none exists. It also loads stored documents from a pickle file if it exists.

- It defines a function `query_index` to search the index for a given query and return the results.

- It defines a function `insert_into_index` to add a new document to the index and save the updated index and documents to disk. The document text is limited to the first 200 characters.

- It defines a function `get_documents_list` to return a list of all stored documents.

If the script is run directly (not imported as a module), it initializes the index and starts a server. The server exposes the `query_index`, `insert_into_index`, and `get_documents_list` functions over a network. The server is password-protected and listens on port 5602.

In summary, this script is creating a server that allows users to add documents to a search index, query the index, and retrieve a list of all stored documents. The server uses multiprocessing for thread-safety and performance.
